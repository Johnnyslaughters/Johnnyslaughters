🩸 BIG DNi: TCC peeps stay away from me edgy ahhh ⋄

🩸 DNI: Basic Criteria Such as Homophobia Transphobia ableist people will not be allowed here just don't be weird.  Cancel Culture. interacting romantically with me. If you don't like self shipping / Oc's cause that's basically my whole personality. 💀 if horror / Problematic characters make you uncomfortable such as Habit and Johnny Sawyer just dni. if you are a minor on a adult server. i will in fact hide and block you if you do / are any of the above.


🩸 Main info: i am always off-tab so just give me a whisper, feel free to Friend me or sit with me just dont be weird cause i soft hide / block :) be aware i do have Dark Humor but i can tone it down if it makes you uncomfortable. i am not a very Social person so excuse me for that. i dont play this game a lot but when i do i am mostly just writing during it or listening to music. all my actions such as Booping people etc are strictly platonic i do in fact have a Boyfriend but he does not play this game besides i do not believe in a 'touch trigger' in this game.. its a Pony GAME get over it.


🩸 : Fandoms: dc Marvel. The boys. invincible. Greek / Norse myth. Scott Pilgrim. Baldurs Gate. dungeons and Dragons. dragon Age. The Witcher. Silent Hill. The Sims. Resident Evil. FNAF. Arcane.

🩸 : i do not tolerate Bullying or Hate comments of any kind towards myself i will simply ignore you cause i am not about to argue with someone who is spreading hate on a damn pony game lol. unfortunately this has happened before hence why i decided to make this page even though this is a game i do not play a lot.


🩸 I have Autism and english is not my first language i am not the greatest with Social situations as i am a very awkward Person, please communicate with me if you think i did something you do not like and let me know. communication is highly needed for me and i think since we are all on the 18+ server so i assume we are all adults so you should know to communicate, so we can solve it


🩸 please ask if you want any of my Socials i prefer to get to know you before randomly adding people ( i am still always allowed to decline )

🩸 Skin wise i am mostly in Cosplay of the Media i have listed in Fandoms or my Ocs you are free to Take Inspo and you do not have to ask me just dont bland out copy them.
